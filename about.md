Graphs. Graphs is all you need. They are everywhere.. Social Networks, Transportation, Telecommunication, Epidemics, Molecular Biology and so on. The underlying Hypothesis is simple, powerful, beautiful and terrifying: I know enough about you if I know all about your connections.

An exciting take on the topic is Representation Learning on Graphs as exemplified by Jure Leskovic, Thomas Kipf and other researchers merging Graph Theory, Signal Processing and Deep Learning.

My focus will be put on applications in Architecture, Urbanism and Literature. For more information about my background, have a look at my [homepage](http://anagno.com/)
