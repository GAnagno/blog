Euclid is one way to see the world. F-B, U-D, L-R, in a binary and neutralized fashion. What about Power, Love, Hate, Revolution, Language, History? Are my friends on my left or on my right? Orientation works differently in a network: it is political. Networks, represented as graphs, have manifold geometries with spectral, quantum metrics. In society, transportation, telecommunication, logistics, epidemic outbreaks, proteins, ..., it is all about signals. Transmitting information, getting a message across.

Mathematically, a node exists only if connected and objects are defined by their role in the network. An exciting approach on the topic is Representation Learning on Graphs as exemplified by modern researchers who merge Graph Theory, Signal Processing and Deep Learning.

My focus is on applications in Architecture and the City. For more information about my background, have a look at my [homepage](http://anagno.com/)
