Euclid is one way to see the world. F-B, U-D, L-R, in a binary and neutralized fashion. What about Power, Love, Hate, Revolution, Language, History? Are my friends on my left or on my right? Orientation works differently in a network: it is political. Networks, represented as graphs, have manifold geometries with spectral, quantum metrics. In society, transportation, telecommunication, logistics, epidemic outbreaks, proteins, ..., it is all about signals. Transmitting information through time and space, getting a message across.

Mathematically, a node exists only if connected. Subjects are primarily defined by their role in the network. An exciting approach on the topic is Representation Learning on Graphs as exemplified by Jure Leskovic, Thomas Kipf and other researchers who merge Graph Theory, Signal Processing and Deep Learning.

My focus is on applications in Architecture and the City. For more information about my background, have a look at my [homepage](http://anagno.com/)
