You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight python %}
plt.figure(figsize = (10,7))
nx.draw(G, pos=pos, edge_color=bond, node_color=ec, with_labels=False, node_size=ec*1000,
        width=bond*20, edge_cmap=plt.cm.Spectral, cmap=plt.cm.Blues_r)
{% endhighlight %}
